# alternate-diagonals
A simple module for Foundry VTT which sets the grid to use alternating diagonals.

## About

This Foundry VTT module allows you to apply the alternate diagonals rule to a game system, notably the "Simple World-Building" system.

"Alternate diagonals" is a grid-based rule where every other diagonal square costs double, sometimes referred to as the 1-2-1 diagonal rule.

This is the standard for Pathfinder 2nd Edition, where the first diagonal square costs 5ft of movement, the second 10ft, the third 5ft, and so on.

## Installation

Either search for and install this module within Foundry VTT, or copy this address into the `Manifest URL` bar:

```

```

## Usage

Once enabled, this module should automatically set all grid interactions to use alternate diagonals.

## Issues

This module may not work with game systems which already implement their own movement rules.

If you encounter any problems, raise a ticket on Github and I'll take a look.
